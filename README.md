# Legal Document Processing Project üìë

Welcome to the Legal Document Processing Project! This project leverages various technologies to ingest, process, and analyze legal and regulatory PDF documents. Below you'll find information about the project's tech stack, functionalities, and how to get started.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine.
- **ChromaDB**: A database management system optimized for storing and querying embeddings and vectors.
- **LangChain**: A library for natural language processing and text analysis.
- **OpenAI**: Utilized for advanced AI capabilities, such as language modeling and text generation.
- **Brave API**: Provides access to various functionalities and data related to legal and regulatory matters.
- **Google Auth**: Used for authentication and authorization purposes.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used throughout the project.

## Functionalities ‚öôÔ∏è

This project offers the following key functionalities:

1. **PDF Ingestion**: Capable of ingesting legal and regulatory PDF documents.
2. **OCR and Image Recognition**: Utilizes neural network models to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and image recognition on PDF documents.
3. **Legal Document Labeling**: Employs Language Model (LLM) to label PDF documents and convert unstructured data into semi-structured data.
4. **Database Integration**: Integrates with SQLite database to store processed data.
5. **Embedding Generation**: Converts semi-structured data into embeddings and stores them in ChromaDB.
6. **AI-Powered Chat Bot**: Exposes a websocket for interacting with an intelligent AI-powered chat bot specializing in legal and regulatory laws and policies.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with the Legal Document Processing Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JeevansSP/ondc-compliance-agent.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure your environment variables for authentication (openai and brave api keys).
4. Run the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

Once the server is up and running, you can start ingesting, processing, and analyzing legal and regulatory PDF documents through the provided API endpoints.
